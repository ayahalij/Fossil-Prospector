##  Description üîç
**Fossil Prospector** is a grid-based excavation game inspired by *Battleship*. In a 10x10 grid, you take on the role of an adventurous paleontologist who must find fossil parts buried across various regions in a race against time and a rival prospector. Your goal is to locate every fossil fragment needed to finish the dinosaur skeleton before the clock runs out or your rival does!

## How to Get Started and Play üéÆ
* The moment the page loads, the game launches automatically.
* Click on any tile in the 10x10 excavation grid to dig.
    * If a fossil portion is found, it will be visually identified.
    * It will display as a miss if you hit plain dirt.
* Your current score and fossil discoveries are displayed in the side panel
* Finding every fossil component before:
    * Time runs out  
    *or*
    * Your competitor discovers first!
* A win message will appear *only if you locate all fossil parts before time ends and before your rival finishes*
* The **Restart** button will allow you to restart the game.

// Pseudocode Overview
- Generate 10x10 grid  
- Randomly place multi-cell fossil parts  
- On dig: check if cell matches fossil location  
- Show hit/miss result visually  
- Track fossil parts found and score  
- Win = all parts uncovered before time or rival
```

## Game Logic üß†

1. When the game loads:
   - Generate and display a 10x10 excavation grid
   - Randomly place multi-cell fossil parts on hidden tiles

2. Fossil placement:
   - Choose fossil sizes (e.g., 2‚Äì5 tiles long)
   - Place fossils without overlapping or going out of bounds

3. On player dig (click):
   - Check if the clicked cell contains a fossil part
   - If yes:
     - Mark as hit
     - Update fossil tracker and increase score
   - If no:
     - Mark as miss
   - Prevent digging the same cell twice

4. Win condition:
   - If all fossil parts are found before time runs out and before the competitor finishes:
     - Display win message and stop the game

5. Lose condition:
   - If time runs out or the competitor completes their excavation first:
     - Display lose message and stop the game

6. Restart:
   - Clear board, reset score, fossils, and timer
   - Start a new game
